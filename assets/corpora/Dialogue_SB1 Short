Uh, do you have a pet Randy?
Uh, yeah, currently we have a poodle.
A poodle, miniature or, uh, full size?
Yeah, uh, it's, uh miniature.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I read somewhere that, the poodles is one of the, the most intelligent dogs, uh, around.
Well, um, I wouldn't, uh, I definitely wouldn't dispute that, it, it's actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got married, but, uh, it, uh, definitely responds to, uh, to authority and, I've had dogs in the past and, uh, it seems, it seems to, uh, respond real well, it, it - she's, she's picked up a lot of things, uh, just, just by, uh, teaching by force, I guess is what I'd like to say.
Oh, uh-huh. So, you, you've only known the dog, wh-, how long did you say.
Well, about a year I guess.
Oh, well, uh, is it, uh, uh, - how old is the dog?
It just turned two, I believe.
Oh, it's still just a pup.
Pretty much, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I have a, uh, well a mutt, myself. I call it a, uh, uh, Chowperd .
Okay.
It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd and it, - as I understand it, uh, both sides of the, were thoroughbreds. So, she's a genuine Chowperd .
Oh, that sounds interesting.
She has the, the color and the black to-, tongue of a Chow, but, uh, she has the shap-, the shape of the, uh, uh, Shepherd.
Oh, that's, that's neat. How, about how big then?
Yeah, yeah.
But she's big enough to be intimidating,
Most definitely.
