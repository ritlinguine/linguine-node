Okay, in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,
Uh-huh.
until it was nice and brown, you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it <cough>.
Uh-huh.
And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil. Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there. And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water. Stir it real, real well.
Uh-huh.
Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy. And you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.
Oh.
And that's going to, it's going to be really good <laughter>.
That's very spicy, too.
Yeah, it's, -
I mean these bell peppers and curry.
Right, and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.
Oh, that sounds really good.
Yeah.
