Dear Mr. Lay, For what it is worth, I believe this move, although very unfortunate given Andy's long service to Enron, is the right thing to do. In the way that Enron has historically been the poster child for corporate innovation, I hope you will now lead us in the direction that makes us the poster child for handling a crisis of investor confidence. Enron is such an amazing company, I trust you will do everything necessary to work cooperatively with the investor community to restore the company to its former greatness. Respectfully yours, Elliot Mainzer

Andy and Dave -- Attached below is the working deal sheet with Enron and Accenture's most recent iterations and comments. If you all could review our feedback and let us know your thoughts, that would be great. Also, Dave, please let me know if you want to move forward with the counsel discussion on Monday. Informally and respectfully, I would like to comment on Enron's sentiment that we have had six weeks to think about some of these things and as a result, the ambiguity should already be gone. I appreciate this point-of-view, but also want to share my perspective with you all: I highlight these dynamics to explain, not excuse, our need to approach things the way that we have. That being said, I will reiterate that we would not even be performing this analysis (itself costly) if we did not have the highest regards for Enron, our collective ability to do well in the marketplace together, and a general bullishness for the value of this offering. I look forward to hearing from you all on Monday. Thanks, Peggy
