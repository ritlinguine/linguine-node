Jeff, Thanks for the floor speech on 32 yesterday. It's always great to hear 'the boss' say that you're doing a good job and that Enron still has a lot in store for the future. You don't know how much that helps us motivate our guys and keep them focused on our goals. Victor

Tanner will be there! Do you know if any of our guys will be leaving early for Spring Break. I don't know if Greg responded to your request for a catchers mitt or not but I have one for back-up. Thanks for the note! Terrell

I totally understand. It sounds exciting though. I can't wait to hear the details. I am with Renee tonight, but I will be home tomorrow night. Why don't we talk then?? Good luck with everything!! -C
