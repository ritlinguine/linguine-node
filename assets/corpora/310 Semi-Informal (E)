britt, thanks your notes below. re bug issue -- noted. just one question; do you think we should notify our suppliers in view that, if there is a problem as a result of the bugs, we will have to proceed against them??? they would want to have a rep to view the testing as well, i would think. re joint testing -- pls copy eric tan on what needs to be done once a decision is made on where/when the testing will be done. re freight payment -- before offering to just pay the $500,000, do you think we should propose it be paid to an interest bearing escrow account pending the results of the joint testing (or whatever other 'pending' limitation you think might help us)?? rgds

Stuart, If Brian has been notified by the counterparty then that's sufficient -- please amend accordingly. Thanks and rgds, Nish

that is the quandary I have several people coming from different parts of Houston, I was hoping we had a pre-made one what do you think is the easiest way, yahoo? dq
