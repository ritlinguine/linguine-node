Why, how now, Juliet?

Madam, I am not well.

Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

What villain, madam?

That same villain Romeo.

Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
